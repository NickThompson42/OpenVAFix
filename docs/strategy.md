# OpenVAFix Technical Strategy

## 🔹 Overview
**OpenVAFix** is an AI-powered system designed to automate VA form processing, eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies, and scale to handle **hundreds of thousands of forms** per month. To achieve this, we are using a **hybrid OCR approach** and a **containerized microservices architecture** that can be deployed in both **government clouds (GovCloud, DoD Cloud)** and **standard infrastructure**.

## 🔹 Hybrid OCR Approach
Since the VA requires **portability and scalability**, we are **starting with an open-source OCR solution (Tesseract)** and later integrating **AWS Textract or OpenAI Vision** for large-scale processing.

### **Why Hybrid OCR?**
| **OCR Approach** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| **Tesseract OCR (Open-Source)** | Portable, self-hosted, works offline | Less accurate on complex layouts, needs fine-tuning |
| **AWS Textract (GovCloud Ready)** | FedRAMP-approved, scales for large VA workloads | Requires cloud setup, cost after free tier |
| **Google Vision API** | Handles handwriting well | Vendor lock-in risk |
| **OpenAI Vision API** | AI-driven OCR, great for document layouts | Limited access, higher cost |

#### **Plan**
1️⃣ **Start with Tesseract OCR for full portability.**  
2️⃣ **Optimize with NLP-based validation.**  
3️⃣ **Allow AWS Textract/OpenAI Vision integration for high-scale deployments.**  

## 🔹 System Architecture
To ensure high **scalability, security, and portability**, OpenVAFix is **containerized and orchestrated via Kubernetes**.

### **🚀 Microservices Breakdown**
- **OCR Processor** → Extracts text from forms (Tesseract now, AWS later).
- **NLP Validator** → AI model cleans & structures OCR output.
- **API Gateway** → Handles form submission, user requests.
- **Frontend Dashboard** → Web UI for veterans & VA staff.
- **Database** → Stores structured form data.
- **Monitoring & Security** → Tracks performance, prevents unauthorized access.

## 🔹 Deployment Plan
- **Local Testing**: Run with Docker Compose.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Kubernetes setup with auto-scaling.
- **FedRAMP Compliance**: Ensure encryption, role-based access, logging.

## 🔹 Next Steps
- 🚀 Implement **OCR pipeline (Tesseract-based)**
- 🏗️ Set up **containerized deployment**
- 🔄 Test **AI validation & structured data export**
- 📡 Scale with **AWS Textract/OpenAI Vision**
