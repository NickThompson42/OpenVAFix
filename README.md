# OpenVAFix

## 🚀 Mission Statement
**OpenVAFix** is an open-source initiative to modernize and automate the **VA form processing system** using AI-driven document processing, workflow automation, and secure integrations. Our goal is to eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies, reduce backlogs, and ensure veterans receive their benefits faster.

## 🔥 Why This Matters
Veterans face **months-long delays** for simple administrative processes like dependency claims, medical benefits, and disability claims. The VA's outdated, manual workflows result in lost paperwork, unnecessary wait times, and unnecessary frustration. **AI can fix this.**

## 💡 What We're Building
- **AI-Powered Form Processing**: OCR & NLP automation for document intake.
- **Automated Verification Pipelines**: Instantly cross-checks data with trusted sources.
- **Self-Service Veteran Portal**: Allows veterans to track form status in real time.
- **API Integrations**: Securely connects with schools, SSA, tax databases, and other required agencies.
- **Fraud Prevention & Transparency**: AI models to flag inconsistencies and eliminate human bottlenecks.

## 📌 Project Roadmap
1. **Phase 1: AI Form Intake & Processing**
   - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for form digitization
   - NLP-based entity extraction for automatic data processing
   - Initial API design for government data verification

2. **Phase 2: Automated Decision-Making**
   - AI-based prioritization of claims
   - Instant verification workflows with government & school records
   - Secure self-service portal for veterans to track progress

3. **Phase 3: Full System Integration**
   - Full-stack automation for VA form processing
   - AI-driven fraud detection & case resolution
   - Policy recommendations to streamline VA operations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI / Flask), PostgreSQL
- **AI Models**: OCR (Tesseract / OpenAI Vision), NLP (spaCy / Hugging Face)
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
